# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Credit card fraud detection involves identifying fraudulent transactions from a pool of legitimate transactions.
The main objective of this project is to find the best model that can detect fraudulent transactions.

# Dataset
I have used kaggle datset of year 2023 and link given below to download the dataset.

Data Source: The dataset was collected from credit card transactions made by European cardholders in 2023, 
with sensitive information removed to ensure privacy and compliance with ethical guidelines.

# Key Features
id : Unique identifier for each transaction

V1-V28 : Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)

Amount : The transaction amount

Class : Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

# Results
The main objective is to find the most suitable model for credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques. 
The accuracies of four models were found and compared. The best model in terms of accuracy is Random Forest, which scored 99.976%. 
By using this model, we can reduce the amount of credit card fraud.
